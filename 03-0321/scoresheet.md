# Score sheet
  * Object
    * Metropolis
      * (Copy and Paste from last week >-<)
      * There is no boolean type in C. when you calculate and assign logical sentence, it will changed as 0 or 1.
      * In C, 0 is false and all other number is true. (even it is negative!)
    * Ex32_equals
      * Okay, if you followed all pdf on LMS, you saw "CompareTo" method in java.
      * c = strcmp(a, b) : return integer as like CompareTo in Java.
      * Objects said "all result have to whether true or false". It means, you have to postprocess datas from strcmp.
      * Then how to compare without checking Capital? make them low! :) (Just use links given by pdf. It is hard to learn how that works.)
      * If you wanna use the method from pdf, make sure that you have to include "ctype.h". tolower() is in here.
    * ComparingNumbers
      * Maybe you all can do without object :)
      * Use long long instead of using long on C side.
      * use char instead of byte on C side.
    * Tax
      * Maybe you all can do without object :)
    * DaysInMonth
      * Maybe you all can do without object :)
    * General
      * 10 points for each source code.
      * Make sure your code can be compiled and met the object, or you will get zero point.
      * you will get 5~9 if you didnt do something you have to do (but not important).
      * Just typo in string or mistake on calculating is OK. there is no minus point.
    * Deduction
      * If some codes have difference between file name and public class name, 10% percent reduce.
      * If some codes file name have space character, 10% percent reduce.
      * If there is additional file on submit, 10% reduce.
    * Total score = General points * (1 - sum of deduction)
