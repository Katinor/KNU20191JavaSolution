# Score sheet
  * Object
    * Celsius2Fahrenheit
    * You have to check what is different between integer and float.
    * If there is no different, wrap 9/5 as (). This make calculate 9/5 as first.
  * Boolean_ex
    * Just writing equal to pdf will be fine on Java side.
    * There is no boolean type in C. when you calculate and assign logical sentence, it will changed as 0 or 1.
    * In C, 0 is false and all other number is true. (even it is negative!)
  * Constant
    * In C, there is no String variable. you have to assign as the array of char.
    * c = strcpy(char[a], char[b]) : copy b and paste on a.
    * c = strcat(char[a], char[b]) : assign a+b to a. NOT C!
    * both function just return pointer. (you dont have to get return variable)
  * Salary
    * Maybe you all can do without object :)
  * CircleArea
    * Double use %lf in C, not %f!
    * in C, you dont have to submit with another output method. only printf is okay in C.
  * General
    * 10 points for each source code.
    * Make sure your code can be compiled and met the object, or you will get zero point.
    * you will get 5~9 if you didnt do something you have to do (but not important).
    * Just typo in string or mistake on calculating is OK. there is no minus point.
  * Deduction
    * If some codes have difference between file name and public class name, 10% percent reduce.
    * If some codes file name have space character, 10% percent reduce.
    * If there is additional file on submit, 10% reduce.
  * Total score = General points * (1 - sum of deduction)
